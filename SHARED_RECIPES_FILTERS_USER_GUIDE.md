# How to Use Shared Recipe Filters

## What's New? 🎉

The "Shared with Me" tab now has powerful filtering options to help you quickly find recipes that have been shared with you!

## Where to Find It

1. Open your Meal Planner App
2. Click on the **"Recipe Library"** tab at the top
3. Select the **"Shared with Me"** sub-tab
4. You'll see three filter dropdowns at the top

## The Three Filters

### 🍳 Select Recipe
- Choose which recipe you want to view
- Shows only recipes that match your other filter selections
- Recipes are listed alphabetically

### 👤 Shared By
- Filter recipes by who shared them with you
- See the email address of the person who shared each recipe
- Select "All Users" to see recipes from everyone

### 🏷️ Tags
- Filter recipes by their tags
- Great for finding recipes that match your needs:
  - Dietary needs: "vegetarian", "gluten-free", "dairy"
  - Cooking methods: "grilled", "baked", "slow-cooked"
  - Meal types: "breakfast", "dessert", "salad"
  - Complexity: "quick", "simple"
- Select "All Tags" to see all recipes regardless of tags

## How to Use the Filters

### Example 1: Find All Recipes from a Specific Person
1. Click the **"Shared By:"** dropdown
2. Select the person's email
3. The "Select Recipe:" dropdown now shows only their recipes
4. Choose a recipe to view its details

### Example 2: Find Quick Dinner Ideas
1. Click the **"Tags:"** dropdown
2. Select "quick"
3. Browse through all quick recipes shared with you
4. Select one to see the full recipe

### Example 3: Combine Filters (Most Powerful!)
Let's say you want to find vegetarian recipes shared by your friend Sarah:

1. Click **"Shared By:"** and select `sarah@email.com`
2. Click **"Tags:"** and select `vegetarian`
3. Now you see only Sarah's vegetarian recipes!
4. Select one from the "Select Recipe:" dropdown

### Example 4: Browse Everything
1. Make sure **"Shared By:"** is set to "All Users"
2. Make sure **"Tags:"** is set to "All Tags"
3. The "Select Recipe:" dropdown shows ALL shared recipes

## Quick Tips 💡

### Tip 1: Filters Reset Your Selection
When you change a filter, your current recipe selection is cleared. This is intentional - it ensures you're viewing a recipe that matches your current filters.

### Tip 2: Start Fresh Easily
Want to clear all filters? Just switch to another tab and come back to "Shared with Me" - all filters will reset automatically!

### Tip 3: Narrow Down Step by Step
If you have many shared recipes:
1. First, use "Tags:" to filter by what you're in the mood for
2. Then, use "Shared By:" if you want to see who shared it
3. Finally, pick from the filtered "Select Recipe:" list

### Tip 4: Works on Mobile Too!
The filters automatically stack vertically on your phone for easy scrolling and tapping. No need to pinch and zoom!

## Common Scenarios

✅ **Solution**: 
- Set "Shared By:" to your mom's email
- Leave "Tags:" as "All Tags"
- Browse her recipes in "Select Recipe:"

### Scenario: "I need quick breakfast ideas"

- Set "Tags:" to "vegetarian"

### Scenario: "I want to explore everything shared with me"
✅ **Solution**:

- Browse all shared recipes alphabetically

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see any recipes"
- Check if your filters are too restrictive
- Try setting both filters back to "All Users" and "All Tags"
- Make sure you're on the "Shared with Me" tab

### "The Shared By dropdown shows 'Loading...'"
- The app is fetching user information
- Wait a moment and it should display email addresses
- If it persists, try switching tabs and coming back

### "I selected a recipe but now it's gone"
- You probably changed a filter, which clears the selection
- This is normal! Just re-select the recipe from the dropdown

### "I want to go back to all recipes"
- Select "All Users" in the "Shared By:" dropdown
- Select "All Tags" in the "Tags:" dropdown
- Or switch tabs and come back

## Need More Help?

If you have questions or suggestions about the filters:
- Check if other users have tagged their recipes (tags make filtering more powerful!)
- Remember that you can only filter recipes that have been shared WITH you
- The filters only show options that exist in your shared recipes
