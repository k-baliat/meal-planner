# Tag Suggestions - User Guide

## What's New?

You now have **quick-add tag suggestion bubbles** in both the Create Recipe and Edit Recipe forms! No more typing common tags manually - just click to add them.

## Where to Find It

1. Navigate to the **Recipe Library** tab
2. Click either:
   - **"Add New Recipe"** button (for creating new recipes)
   - **"Edit"** button on any existing recipe
3. Scroll to the **"Tags (optional):"** section
4. You'll see colorful tag suggestion bubbles organized by category

## How the Tags are Organized

### 🥗 Dietary Tags
Perfect for food preferences and restrictions:
- `gluten`
- `gluten-free`
- `vegetarian`
- `carbs`
- `dairy`
- `spicy`
- `sweet`

### 🍳 Cooking Method Tags
Describe how the recipe is prepared:
- `grilled`
- `baked`
- `fried`
- `slow-cooked`

### 🍽️ Meal Type Tags

- `breakfast`

- `soup`

### ⏱️ Complexity Tags

## How to Use

### Quick Add Method (NEW! ✨)
1. Look at the tag suggestions under "Tags (optional):"
2. Click any tag bubble that applies to your recipe
3. The tag is instantly added to your recipe
4. Added tags turn **green** and become unclickable to prevent duplicates

### Manual Entry Method (Still Available)
1. Type a custom tag in the text input field
2. Either press **Enter** or click **"Add Tag"** button
3. Your custom tag appears in the tags list below

### Removing Tags
- Click the **×** button next to any tag in the "Tags:" list to remove it
- This works for both suggested tags and manually-entered tags

## Visual Feedback

- **Default bubble**: White background with colored border
- **Hover**: Fills with color and slightly lifts up (shows it's clickable)
- **Added tag**: Green background (shows it's already added to your recipe)
- **Disabled**: Gray and non-clickable (can't add duplicates)

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Add Multiple Tags**: Click as many tags as apply to your recipe for better organization
2. **Combine Methods**: Use both quick-add bubbles AND manual entry for custom tags
3. **Be Specific**: More tags = easier to find recipes later (future feature!)
4. **Consistency**: Using suggested tags helps maintain consistent naming across your recipes
